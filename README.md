Running test:
1. Git clone/download repo
2. From console: cd into the downloaded repo/folder
3. Run: npm i
4. Run: npx cypress open
5. From Cypress UI click on rateChangeCheck.spec.js test

P.S.: in order the test fails read and follow the comments on spec file.

P.P.S.: used a workaround to access Rates page as if you go directly to that
page you get some 40x responses and rate fail to load.
